Using the raw data with 2 second epochs, the first setup resulted in about 70% accuracy. One class was slightly more dominant than the other (think left dominated right).

Attempted different time epochs of 1s and 1.5s. Both performed worse than the original 2s epoch. Would a 3s epoch be better than?

Made a new filter script based on the original template for loading and whitening the data. This also decreased performance.

Appears raw data is the best thing to feed the model. Next step is to try to implement some of the tweaks found in the research articles.

Several tests were conducted between all of the different classes.
3 class Left-Right-Rest was classified with 55.8% accuracy.
General motion (Left&Right) vs Rest was classified with 67% accuracy.
Left-Rest was classified with 72.95% accuracy.
Right-Rest was classified with 58.45% accuracy.

Definitely need some improvements. The inclusion of the rest class always makes the problem more difficult.
New algorithms and dictionary optimization could be useful. Also, better preprocessing might help, although it seemed to have a negative impact previously.

Did some stuff (Testing matching pursuit algorithms)
