Using the raw data with 2 second epochs, the first setup resulted in about 70% accuracy. One class was slightly more dominant than the other (think left dominated right). 

Attempted different time epochs of 1s and 1.5s. Both performed worse than the origional 2s epoch. Would a 3s epoch be better than? 

Made a new filter script based on the origional template for loading and whitening the data. This also decreased performace. 

Appears raw data is the best thing to feed the model. Next step is to try to implement some of the tweaks found in the research articles.
